# Red Headed Stepchild of Zen Cart&reg; Google Product Search Feeder II (v1.0.5), Reimagined Release v1.0.13

Red Headed Stepchild of Zen Cart® Google Product Search Feeder II generates Google Merchant Center product feeds from a Zen Cart catalog. This independent fork is based on Google Product Search Feeder II v1.0.5 and updates it for current Zen Cart releases. Reimagined Release v1.0.13 is compatible with Zen Cart 2.2.2 and PHP 8.5 while retaining support for Zen Cart 1.5.6b and later and PHP 7.0 and later.

## Features

- Google RSS/XML or tab-delimited TXT feeds
- Dynamic TXT columns, including attributes supplied by feed extensions
- Per-product or store-wide Google product categories
- Product shipping weight with a configurable packaging increase
- A configurable default weight for products whose catalog weight is empty or zero
- Optional database and admin product fields for `material`, `age_group`, `color`, and `gender`
- Five installable custom product fields with matching database and feed column names
- Server-side feed heartbeat with product counts, progress, memory use, and failure reporting
- Gzip compression, scheduled generation, language selection, and existing GPSF extension support

## Installation and upgrade

1. **Back up the complete store database and files before installing or upgrading.** Verify that the backup can be restored.
2. Rename the package's `YOUR_ADMIN` directory to match the store's admin directory.
3. Upload the package files while preserving their directory structure. Make sure both the catalog-side generator files and admin files are updated.
4. Sign out of Zen Cart admin, then sign back in. The feeder's non-destructive database upgrade runs during admin initialization.
5. Open **Configuration > Red Headed Stepchild of Zen Cart® Google Product Search Feeder II** and confirm that the installed Reimagined Release is `1.0.13`.

The database retains the original `Google Product Search Feeder II` configuration-group identity for upgrade and rollback compatibility. The longer Reimagined Release name is supplied by the admin language files.

When upgrading, do not copy only the admin files. Feed generation runs from catalog-side files such as `includes/classes/gpsfFeedGenerator.php`, so an incomplete upload can show the new version in admin while continuing to generate an older feed.

The optional product columns described below are not created automatically during an upgrade. Back up the database first, then install only the fields the store needs by using their individual controls in the feeder configuration page.

## Admin locations

- **Configuration > Red Headed Stepchild of Zen Cart® Google Product Search Feeder II**: feeder settings and optional-field installation
- **Tools > Red Headed Stepchild of Zen Cart® Google Product Search Feeder II**: generate, inspect, and manage feeds
- **Catalog > Categories/Products**: edit installed per-product Google fields

## Feed formats

Set **Feed Output Format** to either:

- **XML**: the traditional Google RSS/XML feed
- **TXT**: a UTF-8, tab-delimited Google product feed with a header row

TXT generation discovers the attributes actually emitted by the products and writes only columns that contain at least one value. This also preserves attributes added by compatible feeder extensions. Repeated values are comma-delimited, and structured values use colon-delimited subfields in accordance with Google text-feed conventions.

The selected format controls the output filename and compressed filename. For example, a TXT feed is written as `feed/store_products_en.txt`, or `feed/store_products_en.txt.gz` when compression is enabled.

Because TXT headers are dynamic, a field such as `color` is intentionally absent when every generated product has an empty color value.

## Google product category

Category selection uses this precedence:

1. A Google product category already supplied for the product by the feeder's attribute or extension processing
2. The value in the configured products-table column, when enabled and non-empty
3. The store-wide default Google product category

To use a database value, enable **Use Product Category Column**. The **Product Category Column** control shows **Install standard column** when `products_google_product_category` is missing and **Installed** when the selected column exists. Click the installer to create the standard column, or enter and save the name of another existing products-table column. The selected installed column appears as **Google Product Category** on the normal admin product entry/edit page. If a product has no value in that column, the configured default is used.

## Shipping weight

The feeder chooses a base weight and then applies the packaging increase:

```text
base weight = positive products_weight, otherwise Default Shipping Weight
shipping_weight = base weight * (1 + Shipping Weight Increase Percentage / 100)
```

The percentage defaults to `3`, adding 3% to the selected base weight. The default weight is useful for stores whose products do not have catalog weights. If neither the product weight nor the configured default weight is positive, `shipping_weight` is omitted from that product.

The generated value uses the store's configured weight unit. These settings affect only the Merchant Center feed value; they do not change Zen Cart's checkout or shipping-rate calculations.

## Shipping rate coverage

When **Shipping Data Source** uses a calculated Zen Cart method, **Shipping Rate Applies to Country** and **Shipping Rate Applies to Region** identify the customer delivery area attached to the exported `shipping` rate. They do not identify the store or warehouse origin and do not affect the rate calculation.

The country selector displays a readable name and Zen Cart three-letter code, such as `United States (USA)`. The feed converts the selected country to the two-letter code required by Google. Region is optional and exports the `region` sub-attribute, so enter an ISO 3166-2 subdivision code without the country prefix, such as `GA` for Georgia. Do not enter a postal code in the region setting. Google supports region targeting only for specified countries; review the [Google shipping attribute specification](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324484?hl=en) before using it.

## Optional product fields

Reimagined Release v1.0.3 and later can add four independent fields to the products table and Zen Cart admin product editor. In **Configuration > Red Headed Stepchild of Zen Cart® Google Product Search Feeder II**, click the individual **Install** control for each field the store needs.

| Feed attribute | Products-table column | Database type | Admin input |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `material` | `products_material` | `VARCHAR(255)` | Text |
| `age_group` | `products_age_group` | `VARCHAR(32)` | `newborn`, `infant`, `toddler`, `kids`, or `adult` |
| `color` | `products_color` | `VARCHAR(255)` | Text |
| `gender` | `products_gender` | `VARCHAR(16)` | `male`, `female`, or `unisex` |

Each Install action uses a fixed allowlist and an admin security token, and adds only its selected column. It does not remove or overwrite existing product data. Once installed, the field appears on the normal admin product entry/edit page.

Only non-empty values are exported. A value already provided by product attributes or a feeder extension takes precedence over the database field. Stores can therefore install and use only the fields relevant to their inventory.

### Configurable custom product fields

Reimagined Release v1.0.5 and later provide five blank custom product-field slots. Enter a lowercase database and feed column name with no spaces, such as `vehicle_type`, and click **Install**. The installer creates that exact column in the products table, adds a **Google Feed Vehicle Type** entry to the admin product page, and exports populated values under the `vehicle_type` feed heading. Blank slots and blank product values are not exported.

Column names must begin with a lowercase letter, must not begin with `xml`, and may contain lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. The maximum length is 64 characters. Use only a column name supported by the service receiving the feed. Google campaign labels can be installed with the names `custom_label_0` through `custom_label_4`.

**Back up the database before clicking Install.** Installing a custom field changes the products-table structure. To stop using a custom field, edit its configuration setting, empty the field, and save it blank. This disables its admin input and feed export, but it **does not remove the database column or delete any product data stored in that column**. The feeder deliberately provides no column-removal control because automatic removal could permanently destroy product data.

Uninstalling the feeder also leaves optional and custom products-table columns and their data intact. Removing a database column permanently requires a separate, deliberate database-schema change outside this plugin. Make and verify a complete database backup before performing any manual schema removal.

## Generating a feed

Use **Tools > Red Headed Stepchild of Zen Cart® Google Product Search Feeder II** to generate a feed interactively. Scheduled generation can call the catalog feed endpoint with the configured key and other supported parameters. A typical command is:

```sh
wget -q -O /dev/null "https://example.com/index.php?main_page=google_product_feed&feed=yes&key=YOUR_KEY&language=en"
```

Replace the domain, key, and language with the store's values. Protect the feed key as a credential and use HTTPS.

### Feed heartbeat and large stores

Reimagined Release v1.0.4 writes a server-side heartbeat while a feed runs. The admin tool polls that heartbeat independently from the original generation request and displays the current stage, products scanned, products written, products skipped, total products, completion percentage, memory use, elapsed time, and age of the last heartbeat.

The heartbeat is updated at least every five seconds while products are being processed, while a TXT spool is written to the final file, and during gzip compression. If the browser request times out but PHP continues running, the status monitor continues polling. A run is marked unresponsive when no heartbeat is received for more than two minutes. Check the PHP logs before starting another feed when that warning appears.

Heartbeat data is stored in a hidden status file beside the configured feed output. Successful and failed runs retain their final status for inspection. Gzip compression is streamed in chunks so a large completed feed is not loaded into PHP memory all at once.
